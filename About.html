        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Japnam! I am a second year student studying Computing Science at Simon Fraser University and number 3 developer who loves to fix problems and create something that makes a difference. My introduction to tech began with a programmed computer-programming major in high school that got my attention and made me wonder how tech makes our lives what they are and how I could also be involved into creating it. Since that time I have enhanced my abilities by taking classes in software development, data and algorithm structures, and computer systems as well as how I work with others, think on my feet, and study on a tight schedule.</p>
        <p>I like to translate ideas into actual working solutions, particularly when I am allowed to communicate with others and seek innovative ways of looking at a problem. As both a sole coder and team coder, I prefer clean elegant design and a desire to always work on a project to be better.</p>
        <p>Non-tech-wise, I love hockey and am a committed (and very optimistic) fan of the Canucks. When I do not watch the game, chances are that I am out biking, hiking or working on motorcycles. I like knowing how things work whether it is code or machine and I always want to learn something new or find a new trail, cafe or side project. In my case, I am growing by keeping an inquisitive attitude and being connected, whether in technology or in life.</p>
